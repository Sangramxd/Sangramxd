## 🚀 Featured Projects

### **01. Water Purity Detection System**
*Aug - Dec 2024*

Developed a bio-inspired soft robotic underwater drone capable of autonomously monitoring pH levels in real time. Designed the soft-robotic structure, integrated pH sensors with IoT hardware, and programmed the navigation and data-collection system in Python. The prototype demonstrated stable and repeatable pH measurements with less than 5% drift while significantly improving spatial coverage through mobile sensing.

**Tech Stack:** `Python` `Robotics` `IoT` `Soft Robotics`

### **02. Deepfake Voice Detection**
*Jan - May 2025*

Built a reinforcement learning–based neural architecture search (NAS) framework to automatically design models for deepfake voice detection. Implemented a complete audio-processing pipeline with log-mel feature extraction and trained baseline CNN models in PyTorch, achieving an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.8% after 50 epochs. Integrated a policy-gradient RL controller to explore new model architectures.

**Tech Stack:** `PyTorch` `Reinforcement Learning` `Audio Processing` `NAS`

### **03. SLAM Simulation Environment**
*Aug 2024 - May 2025*

Created a high-fidelity Isaac Sim environment for evaluating SLAM algorithms in wheel-loader hauling and loading operations. Designed complex terrain, dynamic obstacles, and realistic mining layouts, and integrated ROS2 communication along with LiDAR and stereo camera simulations. This environment produced high-quality sensor data for testing mapping, localization, and multi-sensor fusion algorithms under repeatable conditions.
